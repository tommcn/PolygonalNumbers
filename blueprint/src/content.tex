\begin{definition}[Polygonal]
    \label{def:polygonal}
    \lean{Polygonal}
    An integer $n$ is said to be polygonal of order $m$ if:

    \[
        \exists k \in \Z \quad n = \frac{m-2}{2}\cdot (k \cdot (k-1)) + k
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cauchy's Polygonal Number Theorem]
    \label{thm:thmone}
    \lean{CauchyPolygonalNumberTheorem}
    \uses{def:polygonal}
    Let $m\geq 3$ and $n\geq 120\cdot m$ be integers. Then $n$ is the sum of $m+1$ polygonal numbers of order $m+2$, at most $4$ of which are different from $0$ or $1$.
